        /* Note: The reasoning behind this is a bit difficult to immediately grok because it's not obvious but what it does is ensure that the algorithm enumerates through each year or month if they are not explicitly set in the DateComponents passed in by the caller.  This only applies to cases where the highest set unit is month or day (at least for now).
         For ex, let's say comps is set the following way:
         { Day: 31 }
         We want to enumerate through all of the months that have a 31st day.  If strict is set, the algorithm automagically skips over the months that don't have a 31st day and we pass the desired results to the caller.  However, if any of the approximation options are set, we can't skip the months that don't have a 31st day - we need to provide the appropriate approximate date for them.  Calling this method allows us to see that day is the highest unit set in comps, and sets the month value in compsToMatch (previously unset in matchingComponents) to whatever the month is of the date we're using to search.

         Ex: searchingDate is '2016-06-10 07:00:00 +0000' so { Day: 31 } becomes { Month: 6, Day: 31 } in compsToMatch

         This way, the algorithm from here on out sees that month is now the highest set unit and we ensure that we search for the day we want in each month and provide an approximation when we can't find it, thus getting the results the caller expects.

         Ex: { Month: 6, Day: 31 } does not exist so if nextTime is set, we pass '2016-07-01 07:00:00 +0000' to the block.

                 If nextHighestUnit is day, it's a safe assumption that the highest actual set unit is the hour.
                 There are cases where we're looking for a minute and/or second within the first hour of the day. If we start just at the top of the day and go backwards, we could end up missing the minute/second we're looking for.
                 E.g.
                 We're looking for { hour: 0, minute: 30, second: 0 } in the day before the start date 2017-05-26 07:19:50 UTC. At this point, foundRange.start would be 2017-05-26 07:00:00 UTC.
                 In this case, the algorithm would do the following:
                     start at 2017-05-26 07:00:00 UTC, see that the hour is already set to what we want, jump to minute.
                     when checking for minute, it will cycle forward to 2017-05-26 07:30:00 +0000 but then compare to the start and see that that date is incorrect because it's in the future. Then it will cycle the date back to 2017-05-26 06:30:00 +0000.
                     the matchingDate call below will exit with 2017-05-26 06:30:00 UTC and the algorithm will see that date is incorrect and reset the new search date go back a day to 2017-05-25 07:19:50 UTC. Then we get back here to this method and move the start to 2017-05-25 07:00:00 UTC and the call to matchingDate below will return 2017-05-25 06:30:00 UTC, which skips what we want (2017-05-25 07:30:00 UTC) and the algorithm eventually keeps moving further and further into the past until it exhausts itself and returns nil.
                 To adjust for this scenario, we add this line below that sets nextSearchDate to the last minute of the previous day (using the above example, 2017-05-26 06:59:59 UTC), which causes the algorithm to not skip the minutes/seconds within the first hour of the previous day.
