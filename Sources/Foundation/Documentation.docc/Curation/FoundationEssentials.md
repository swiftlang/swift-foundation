# Foundation Essentials

Access core types and essential functionality used by most applications.

## Overview

The Foundation Essentials package provides the most important types for everyday development:

* Core types beyond those provided by the Swift standard library, such as ``Data`` and ``UUID``.
* Dates and time intervals.
* An ``AttributedString`` type for strings with runs of metadata, such as styling information.
* JSON encoding and decoding.
* A ``URL`` type for network and local resources.

Foundation Essentials provides a canonical implementation of these types, so developers can count on consistent behavior, regardless of platform.
