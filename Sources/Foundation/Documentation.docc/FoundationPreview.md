Access essential data types, collections, and operating-system services to define the base layer of functionality for your app.

## Overview

The Foundation framework provides a base layer of functionality for apps and frameworks, including data storage and persistence, text processing, date and time calculations, sorting and filtering, and networking.

Swift Foundation modularizes its functionality into smaller packages, which you can import separately if you only need a subset of Foundation's feature set.
