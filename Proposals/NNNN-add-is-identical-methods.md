## Introduction

We propose new `isIdentical` instance methods to concrete types for determining in constant-time if two instances must be equal by-value.

## Motivation

Suppose we have some code that listens to strings from an `AsyncSequence`. Every string received from the `AsyncSequence` is then used to perform some work that scales linearly with the size of the string:

```swift
func doLinearOperation(with string: String) {
  //  perform some operation
  //  scales linearly with string
}

func f1<S>(sequence: S) async throws
where S: AsyncSequence, S.Element == String {
  for try await string in sequence {
    doLinearOperation(with: string)
  }
}
```

Suppose we know that `doLinearOperation` only performs important work when `string` is not equal to the last value (here we define “equal” to imply “value equality”). The *first* call to `doLinearOperation` is important, and the *next* calls to `doLinearOperation` are only important if `string` is not equal by-value to the last `string` that was used to perform `doLinearOperation`.

Since we know that `String` conforms to `Equatable`, we can choose to “memoize” our values *before* we perform `doLinearOperation`:

```swift
func f2<S>(sequence: S) async throws
where S: AsyncSequence, S.Element == String {
  var oldString: String?
  for try await string in sequence {
    if oldString == string { continue }
    oldString = string
    doLinearOperation(with: string)
  }
}
```

When our `sequence` produces many strings that are equal by-value, “eagerly” passing that string to `doLinearOperation` performs more work than necessary. Performing a check for value-equality *before* we pass that string to `doLinearOperation` saves us the work from performing `doLinearOperation` more than necessary, but we have now traded performance in a different direction. Because we know that the work performed in `doLinearOperation` scales linearly with the size of the `string`, and we know that the `==` operator *also* scales linearly with the size of the `string`, we now perform *two* linear operations whenever our `sequence` delivers a new `string` that is not equal by-value to the previous input to `doLinearOperation`.

At this point our product engineer has to make a tradeoff: do we “eagerly” perform the call to `doLinearOperation` *without* a preflight check for value equality on the expectation that `sequence` will produce many non-equal values, or do we perform the call to `doLinearOperation` *with* a preflight check for value equality on the expectation that `sequence` will produce many equal values?

There is a third path forward… a “quick” check against `String` values that returns in constant-time and *guarantees* these instances *must* be equal by value. We can add a similar check to additional concrete types from Foundation.

## Prior Art

`String` already ships a public-but-underscored API that returns in constant time.[^1]

```swift
extension String {
  /// Returns a boolean value indicating whether this string is identical to
  /// `other`.
  ///
  /// Two string values are identical if there is no way to distinguish between
  /// them.
  ///
  /// Comparing strings this way includes comparing (normally) hidden
  /// implementation details such as the memory location of any underlying
  /// string storage object. Therefore, identical strings are guaranteed to
  /// compare equal with `==`, but not all equal strings are considered
  /// identical.
  ///
  /// - Performance: O(1)
  @_alwaysEmitIntoClient
  public func _isIdentical(to other: Self) -> Bool {
    self._guts.rawBits == other._guts.rawBits
  }
}
```

We don’t see this API currently being used in Standard Library, but it’s possible this API is already being used to optimize performance in private frameworks from Apple.

Many more examples of `isIdentical` functions are currently shipping in `Swift-Collections`[^2][^3][^4][^5][^6][^7][^8][^9][^10][^11][^12][^13], `Swift-Markdown`[^14], and `Swift-CowBox`[^15]. We also support `isIdentical` on the upcoming `Span` and `RawSpan` types from Standard Library.[^16]

## Proposed Solution

Many types in Foundation are “copy-on-write” data structures. These types present as value types, but can leverage a reference to some shared state to optimize for performance. When we copy this value we copy a reference to shared storage. If we perform a mutation on a copy we can preserve value semantics by copying the storage reference to a unique value before we write our mutation: we “copy” on “write”.

This means that many types in Foundation already have some private reference that can be checked in constant-time to determine if two values are identical. Because these types copy before writing, two values that are identical by their shared storage *must* be equal by value.

Suppose our `_isIdentical` method from `String` was no longer underscored. We could now refactor our operation on `AsyncSequence` to:

```swift
func f3<S>(sequence: S) async throws
where S: AsyncSequence, S.Element == String {
  var oldString: String?
  for try await string in sequence {
    if oldString?.isIdentical(to: string) ?? false { continue }
    oldString = string
    doLinearOperation(with: string)
  }
}
```

What has this done for our performance? We know that `doLinearOperation` performs a linear operation over `string`. We also know that `isIdentical` returns in constant-time. If `isIdentical` returns `true` we skip performing `doLinearOperation`. If `isIdentical` returns `false` we perform `doLinearOperation`, but this is now *one* linear operation. We will potentially perform this linear operation *even if* the `element` returned is equal by-value, but since the preflight check to confirm value equality was *itself* a linear operation, we now perform one linear operation instead of two.

## Detailed Design

Here is a new method defined on `AttributedString`:

```swift
@available(FoundationPreview 6.3, *)
extension AttributedString {
  /// Returns a boolean value indicating whether this attributed string is identical to
  /// `other`.
  ///
  /// Two attributed string values are identical if there is no way to distinguish between
  /// them.
  ///
  /// Comparing attributed strings this way includes comparing (normally) hidden
  /// implementation details such as the memory location of any underlying
  /// string storage object. Therefore, identical attributed strings are guaranteed to
  /// compare equal with `==`, but not all equal attributed strings are considered
  /// identical.
  ///
  /// - Complexity: O(1)
  @available(FoundationPreview 6.3, *)
  public func isIdentical(to other: Self) -> Bool { ... }
}
```

We propose adding `isIdentical` methods to the following concrete types from Foundation:
* AttributedString
* AttributedSubstring
* Data

The methods follow the same pattern from `AttributedString`. Every `isIdentical` method is an instance method that takes one parameter of the same type and returns a `Bool` value in constant-time indicating two instances must be equal by value. Here is an example on `Data`:

```swift
@available(FoundationPreview 6.3, *)
extension Data {
  /// Returns a boolean value indicating whether this data is identical to
  /// `other`.
  ///
  /// Two data values are identical if there is no way to distinguish between
  /// them.
  ///
  /// Comparing datas this way includes comparing (normally) hidden
  /// implementation details such as the memory location of any underlying
  /// data storage object. Therefore, identical datas are guaranteed to
  /// compare equal with `==`, but not all equal datas are considered
  /// identical.
  ///
  /// - Complexity: O(1)
  @available(FoundationPreview 6.3, *)
  public func isIdentical(to other: Self) -> Bool { ... }
}
```

## Source Compatibility

This proposal is additive and source-compatible with existing code.

## Impact on ABI

This proposal is additive and ABI-compatible with existing code.

## Future Directions

Any Foundation types that are copy-on-write values that also conform to `Equatable` would be good candidates to add `isIdentical` functions.

The following types from Foundation have an easy ability to check for `isIdentical`:
* TimeZone
* URL

Our initial proposal includes concrete types we expect to be most often used to perform quick comparisons. It’s not completely clear if `TimeZone` and `URL` would be used enough in these situations to justify the engineering time to write the implementations, write the tests, write the documentation, and also maintain all of those over time. We could return to `TimeZone` and `URL` in the future if we need to.

## Alternatives Considered

### Overload for `===`

Could we “overload” the `===` operator from `AnyObject`? This proposal considers that question to be orthogonal to our goal of exposing identity equality with the `isIdentical` instances methods. We could choose to overload `===`, but this would be a larger “conceptual” and “philosophical” change because the `===` operator is currently meant for `AnyObject` types — not value types like `String` and `Array`.

### Overload for Optionals

When working with `Optional` attributed string values we can add the following overload:

```swift
@available(FoundationPreview 6.3, *)
extension Optional {
  @available(FoundationPreview 6.3, *)
  public func isIdentical(to other: Self) -> Bool
  where Wrapped == AttributedString {
    switch (self, other) {
    case let (value?, other?):
      return value.isIdentical(to: other)
    case (nil, nil):
      return true
    default:
      return false
    }
  }
}
```

Because this overload needs no `private` or `internal` symbols from Foundation, we can omit this overload from our proposal. Product engineers that want this overload can choose to implement it for themselves.

### Alternative Semantics

Instead of publishing an `isIdentical` function which implies two types *must* be equal, could we think of things from the opposite direction? Could we publish a `maybeDifferent` function which implies two types *might not* be equal? This then introduces some potential ambiguity for product engineers: to what extent does “maybe different” imply “probably different”? This ambiguity could be settled with extra documentation on the protocol, but `isIdentical` solves that ambiguity up-front. The `isIdentical` function is also consistent with the prior art in this space.

In the same way this proposal exposes a way to quickly check if two `AttributedString` values *must* be equal, product engineers might want a way to quickly check if two `AttributedString` values *must not* be equal. This is an interesting idea, but this can exist as an independent proposal. We don’t need to block the review of this proposal on a review of `isNotIdentical` semantics.
